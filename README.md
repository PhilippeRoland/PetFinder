The data used in this notebook is taken from the Kaggle competition "PetFinder.my Adoption Prediction".
It contains extensive information (including pictures and text descriptions) of nearly 15000 cats and dogs listed by the Petfinder adoption website, and specifically the speed at which each animal was adopted. The objective of said competition was to predict the adoption speed for any given animal.

This notebook was NOT used to compete in the competition, and is instead meant as a way to learn exploratory analysis - understanding the data, unearthing correlations, and finding any data that may be useful to extract business value from it.
The analysis below will nonetheless be focused on the competition objectives, and will thus aim specifically to explore dataset features as they relate to adoption speed, as well as find and extract new, relevant features.
If time allows, these features will then be used to model the problem and attempt to make predictons.

This specific dataset was chosen because the author has some experience volunteering at a shelter; it is assumed (perhaps wrongly!) that this will make the exploration process and the discovery of new features more intuitive.
